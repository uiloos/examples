      The example above shows a datepicker component which is implemented as a
      custom element that integrates with regular HTML form elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does this by creating a web component which has the "formAssociated"
      static property set to true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tip: try entering "today" or "yesterday" or "tomorrow" in the inputs
      without the quotes!
    </p>
